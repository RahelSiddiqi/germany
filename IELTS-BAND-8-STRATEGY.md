**Band 8 Part 3 Answer Structure:**

```
Question: "How has technology changed education?"

Band 6-7 Answer:
"Technology has changed education a lot. Now we have online classes and computers. It's very useful."

Band 8 Answer:
"Technology has revolutionized education in several profound ways.
Firstly, it has democratized access to knowledge - platforms like
Coursera and Khan Academy provide quality education to anyone with
internet access, regardless of geographical location. However, this
digital transformation has also created challenges, particularly the
digital divide, where students in rural or economically disadvantaged
areas may lack the necessary infrastructure. Moreover, while technology
facilitates personalized learning through adaptive algorithms, there's
a risk of over-reliance on screens, potentially diminishing face-to-face
interaction skills. On balance, I believe the benefits outweigh the
drawbacks, provided we address equity issues systematically."
