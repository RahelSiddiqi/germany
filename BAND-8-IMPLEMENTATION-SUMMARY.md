## 💰 SCHOLARSHIP STRATEGY

3. **Friedrich Ebert** (Apr 30) - €934/month → Social justice focus
4. **Hanns Seidel** (Jul 31) - €934/month → Less competitive
5. **Deutschlandstipendium** (After admission) - €300/month → Apply at EVERY admitted university!

### Funding Potential:

-   DAAD alone = €22,000+ for 2 years (covers EVERYTHING!)
-   Even €300/month = €7,200 savings
-   Multiple scholarships possible = Stack them!
