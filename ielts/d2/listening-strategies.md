## 🔑 KEYWORD Recognition

### What are Keywords?

-   Content words that carry meaning
-   Usually nouns, verbs, adjectives
-   Help you predict and locate answers

### Before You Listen

1. **Read questions carefully** (use 30-second preview)
2. **Underline keywords**
3. **Think of synonyms** (they will paraphrase!)
4. **Predict answer type** (name? number? place?)

### Keyword Transformation Examples

| Question Says | Audio Says                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| cheap         | affordable, inexpensive, economical |
| old           | ancient, elderly, historic          |
| problem       | issue, challenge, difficulty        |
| important     | significant, crucial, essential     |
| help          | assist, support, aid                |
| big           | large, enormous, huge               |
| reduce        | decrease, cut, lower, minimize      |
| children      | kids, youngsters, young people      |
| doctor        | physician, GP, medical professional |
| teacher       | instructor, educator, tutor         |

### Practice: Predict Synonyms

What might the audio say instead of:

1. **expensive** → **\_**, **\_**, **\_**
2. **improve** → **\_**, **\_**, **\_**
3. **fast** → **\_**, **\_**, **\_**
4. **building** → **\_**, **\_**, **\_**
5. **students** → **\_**, **\_**, **\_**

<details>
<summary>Possible Answers</summary>

1. expensive → costly, pricey, high-priced
2. improve → enhance, develop, get better
3. fast → quick, rapid, swift
4. building → structure, premises, facility
5. students → learners, pupils, undergraduates
 </details>
