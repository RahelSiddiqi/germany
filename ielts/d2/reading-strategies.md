## 🔍 SKIMMING Technique

### What is Skimming?

Quick reading to get the **main idea** and **general structure**.

### When to Use

-   First 2-3 minutes of each passage
-   To understand the topic and organization
-   Before reading questions

### How to Skim

1. **Read the title** - Main topic
2. **Read first paragraph** - Introduction/context
3. **Read first sentence** of each paragraph - Topic sentences
4. **Read last paragraph** - Conclusion/summary
5. **Note any** headings, subheadings, bold text

### Skimming Speed

-   **Target:** 500-600 words per minute
-   **Time:** 2-3 minutes per passage

### Practice Exercise: Skim this Paragraph

> Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our era. Scientists have documented rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and increasingly severe weather events. While governments worldwide have pledged to reduce carbon emissions, progress remains slow. Some argue that technological innovation will solve the crisis, while others advocate for fundamental changes in consumption patterns. The debate continues, but the evidence for action grows stronger each year.

**Questions (don't re-read, answer from memory):**

1. What is the main topic? **\_**
2. What are the two viewpoints mentioned? **\_**
3. What is the conclusion? **\_**

## 🔎 SCANNING Technique

### What is Scanning?

Looking for **specific information** without reading everything.

### When to Use

-   After skimming, to find answers
-   Looking for names, dates, numbers
-   Finding specific keywords

### How to Scan

1. **Identify keywords** in the question
2. **Find synonyms** of those keywords
3. **Move eyes quickly** over text
4. **Look for visual cues** (capitals, numbers, italics)
5. **Stop when found** - read around it

### Keywords to Scan For

| Type            | Examples                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Names           | Einstein, Dr. Smith, NASA       |
| Dates           | 1990, 20th century, during WWII |
| Numbers         | 45%, 3.5 million, doubled       |
| Places          | London, Pacific Ocean, Europe   |
| Technical terms | photosynthesis, GDP, algorithm  |

### Practice Exercise: Scan for Answers

> The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the world's largest coral reef system. Spanning approximately 2,300 kilometers, it contains over 900 islands and 2,900 individual reefs. The reef was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. Marine biologists estimate that 10% of the world's fish species can be found in this ecosystem. However, since 2016, the reef has experienced four mass bleaching events due to rising ocean temperatures.

**Scan for these answers (15 seconds max):**

1. Where is the reef located? **\_**
2. How long is it? **\_**
3. When did it become a World Heritage Site? **\_**
4. What percentage of fish species live there? **\_**
5. How many bleaching events since 2016? **\_**

## 📋 TRUE / FALSE / NOT GIVEN Strategy

### Key Definitions

| Answer        | Meaning                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **TRUE**      | The statement matches what the text says         |
| **FALSE**     | The statement contradicts (opposite of) the text |
| **NOT GIVEN** | The information is not in the text               |

### Common Mistakes

❌ Using your own knowledge
❌ Assuming NOT GIVEN means FALSE
❌ Overthinking clear answers

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Read the statement** carefully
2. **Underline keywords**
3. **Scan** for those keywords/synonyms
4. **Compare** statement with text
5. **Decide:** Match? Opposite? Not there?

### Practice: T/F/NG

**Text:**

> The Amazon rainforest produces approximately 20% of the world's oxygen. It covers 5.5 million square kilometers across nine countries, with Brazil containing the largest portion. Deforestation rates have increased in recent years, with satellite data showing significant forest loss.

**Statements:**

1. The Amazon produces about 20% of global oxygen. → **\_**
2. The Amazon is located entirely in Brazil. → **\_**
3. Deforestation affects local wildlife populations. → **\_**
4. Satellite technology monitors the Amazon. → **\_**

<details>
<summary>Answers</summary>

1. **TRUE** - "approximately 20%" matches "about 20%"
2. **FALSE** - Text says "across nine countries" (opposite)
3. **NOT GIVEN** - Wildlife not mentioned
4. **TRUE** - "satellite data" = satellite technology is used
 </details>

## 📑 MATCHING HEADINGS Strategy

### What It Tests

-   Understanding main idea of paragraphs
-   Distinguishing between main idea and details

### Strategy

1. **Read all headings first** - Get an overview
2. **Skim each paragraph** - Topic sentence focus
3. **Match the main idea** - Not details
4. **Cross off used headings**
5. **Double-check** difficult matches

### Common Traps

⚠️ Headings using same words as paragraph (may be wrong!)
⚠️ Details vs. main idea confusion
⚠️ Two paragraphs seeming to fit one heading

### Keywords for Main Ideas

| If paragraph discusses... | Heading might say...             |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| A problem                 | Challenges, Issues, Difficulties |
| A solution                | Responses, Remedies, Answers     |
| History                   | Origins, Development, Evolution  |
| Benefits                  | Advantages, Positive aspects     |
| Examples                  | Illustrations, Cases, Instances  |
| Future                    | Prospects, Predictions, Outlook  |

## ⏱️ Time Management

### Recommended Timing

| Passage   | Time      | Strategy                   |
| --------- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| Passage 1 | 18-20 min | Easiest - build confidence |
| Passage 2 | 20 min    | Medium difficulty          |
| Passage 3 | 20-22 min | Hardest - allow extra time |

### Time-Saving Tips

1. **Don't read everything** - Use skimming/scanning
2. **Don't get stuck** - Move on, come back
3. **Answer all questions** - Never leave blank
4. **Transfer answers quickly** - Last 2-3 minutes
