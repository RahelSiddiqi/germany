## 🔑 Essential Process Language

### Sequencing Words

| Position  | Words                                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start     | First, Initially, At the first stage, To begin with            |
| Middle    | Then, Next, After that, Subsequently, Following this           |
| Same time | Meanwhile, At the same time, Simultaneously, During this stage |
| End       | Finally, Lastly, In the final stage, Eventually                |

### Passive Voice Structures

**Simple passive (most common):**

> "The materials **are collected** from farms."
> "The product **is heated** to 100°C."

**Passive with modal verbs:**

> "The mixture **can be stored** for up to 3 days."
> "The product **must be dried** before packaging."

**Passive with "where/which":**

> "The factory, **where the materials are processed**, is located..."
> "The container, **which is filled with water**, is then heated."

### Common Process Verbs (Passive)

| Active     | Passive            | Example                      |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| collect    | is/are collected   | Materials are collected      |
| transport  | is/are transported | Products are transported     |
| sort       | is/are sorted      | Items are sorted by size     |
| wash       | is/are washed      | The raw materials are washed |
| heat       | is/are heated      | The mixture is heated        |
| mix        | is/are mixed       | Ingredients are mixed        |
| filter     | is/are filtered    | Water is filtered            |
| dry        | is/are dried       | The product is dried         |
| package    | is/are packaged    | Goods are packaged           |
| store      | is/are stored      | Items are stored             |

## 📝 Sample Process Answer

### Diagram: How chocolate is made

**Introduction:**
The diagram illustrates the manufacturing process of chocolate, from the initial harvesting of cacao beans to the final production of chocolate bars.

**Overview:**
Overall, the process involves ten distinct stages, beginning with the collection of ripe cacao pods and concluding with the packaging of chocolate products. The beans undergo several transformations, including drying, roasting, and mixing with other ingredients.

**Body 1:**
Initially, ripe cacao pods are harvested from trees and then split open to extract the beans. These beans are subsequently spread out to dry in the sun for approximately one to two weeks. Once dried, the beans are packed into sacks and transported to the factory.

**Body 2:**
At the factory, the beans are first roasted at high temperatures, which develops their flavor. Following this, the outer shells are removed, and the inner nibs are crushed to produce cacao liquor. This liquor is then mixed with sugar and milk to create chocolate. Finally, the mixture is poured into molds, cooled, and packaged for distribution to retailers.

## 📝 Sample Map Answer

### Maps: Changes to Westbury from 1965 to 2015

**Introduction:**
The two maps compare the town of Westbury in 1965 and 2015, highlighting the changes that occurred over this 50-year period.

**Overview:**
Overall, Westbury has undergone substantial development, transforming from a primarily rural area to an urban residential zone. The most significant changes include the replacement of farmland with housing and the expansion of the road network.

**Body 1 (Western area):**
In 1965, the western side of Westbury was dominated by farmland. By 2015, this agricultural land had been completely replaced by a large housing estate. Additionally, the small path that previously crossed the farmland was widened and developed into a main road connecting the new residential area to the town center.

**Body 2 (Eastern area and other changes):**
On the eastern side, the woods that existed in 1965 have been partially cleared to make way for a shopping mall. However, a section of woodland was retained in the northeastern corner. The river running through the center of the town remained unchanged throughout the period. Furthermore, a new bridge was constructed over the river to improve access between the eastern and western areas.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using Active Voice

❌ "Workers built a hospital."
✅ "A hospital was built."

### Mistake 2: Wrong Tense

❌ "A road is constructed in 2010."
✅ "A road was constructed in 2010."

### Mistake 3: No Overview

❌ Going straight to details
✅ Always include main trends first

### Mistake 4: Describing Everything

❌ Mentioning every tiny change
✅ Focus on significant changes

### Mistake 5: Using Personal Opinion

❌ "I think the development was good."
✅ Just describe what changed
