## 📝 Part 1: Sample Questions & Answers

**Q: What do you like most about your hometown?**

**Q: Has your hometown changed much in recent years?**

**Q: What's your favorite gadget?**

**Q: Do you think older people have difficulty with technology?**

> "To some extent, yes. My grandparents, for example, initially struggled with smartphones. However, I've noticed that many older people are becoming increasingly tech-savvy. My father, who's in his sixties, now uses video calling regularly to keep in touch with relatives abroad."

### Topic: HEALTH & FITNESS

**Q: What do you do to stay healthy?**

## 🗣️ PART 3: Two-Way Discussion

### What to Expect

-   Abstract, deeper questions
-   Related to Part 2 topic
-   Requires opinions, analysis, speculation

### Question Types

1. **Opinion:** "What do you think about...?"
2. **Compare:** "How has X changed compared to the past?"
3. **Speculate:** "Do you think X will change in the future?"
4. **Evaluate:** "What are the advantages/disadvantages of...?"
5. **Generalize:** "Why do people...?"

### Response Structure

**Step 1:** Give your opinion
**Step 2:** Explain/elaborate
**Step 3:** Give an example
**Step 4:** Add another perspective (optional)

### Sample Part 3 Exchanges

**Topic:** Technology (from Part 2 about a gadget)

**Q: How has technology changed the way people communicate?**

> "Technology has completely revolutionized communication, I'd say. In the past, people relied on letters and landline phones, which often meant waiting days or even weeks for responses. Now, with instant messaging and video calls, we can connect with anyone in the world in seconds.

> However, I think there's a downside too. Face-to-face interaction has decreased, and some argue that digital communication lacks the depth of in-person conversations. For example, it's easy to misinterpret the tone of a text message because there are no visual cues."

**Q: Do you think technology will make traditional jobs obsolete?**

> "That's an interesting question. I believe some jobs will inevitably disappear – routine tasks that can be automated are already being replaced by machines. For instance, self-checkout machines have reduced the need for cashiers in many supermarkets.

> However, I'm optimistic that new jobs will emerge to replace them. History has shown that technological advances create opportunities as well as challenges. The key will be ensuring that people have access to training and education to adapt to the changing job market."
