| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1. Introduction | Hook + Paraphrase + Thesis       | 40-50  |

## ✏️ Paragraph 1: Introduction

### Structure:

1. **General statement** (paraphrase topic)
2. **Thesis statement** (your position)

### Template for Opinion Essay:

> [Paraphrase the topic]. In my opinion, I [strongly] agree/disagree with this view because [reason 1] and [reason 2].

### Template for Discussion Essay:

> [Paraphrase the topic]. While some argue that [view 1], others believe [view 2]. This essay will discuss both perspectives before presenting my own view.

### Example:

**Question:** "Some people think that governments should spend money on public services rather than the arts. To what extent do you agree?"

**Introduction:**

> It is often argued that public funding should prioritize essential services over cultural activities such as art and music programs. I partially agree with this position; while public services are certainly more pressing, the arts also deserve some level of government investment.

---

## ✏️ Paragraphs 2 & 3: Body Paragraphs

### Structure (PEEL):

1. **P**oint - Topic sentence (main idea)
2. **E**xplanation - Elaborate on the point
3. **E**vidence - Example or support
4. **L**ink - Connect to thesis/next point

### Topic Sentence Starters:

-   "One of the main reasons I [agree/disagree] is that..."
-   "The primary argument in favor of X is..."
-   "Firstly, it is evident that..."
-   "Another significant consideration is..."

### Example Body Paragraph:

> **Point:** One of the main reasons public services should take priority is that they meet fundamental human needs.

> **Explanation:** Healthcare, education, and infrastructure are essential for the well-being of citizens and the functioning of society. Without adequate investment in these areas, people may suffer from preventable diseases, lack education, or face transportation difficulties.

> **Evidence:** For example, countries like Sweden and Germany, which consistently invest heavily in public services, rank among the highest in quality of life indices globally.

> **Link:** Therefore, it is clear that directing government funds toward public services has tangible benefits for the population.

## ✏️ Paragraph 4: Conclusion

### What to Include:

-   Restate your position (different words)
-   Summarize main points briefly
-   Optional: Future implication or recommendation

### What NOT to Include:

-   ❌ New ideas or arguments
-   ❌ "In my opinion" (save for intro/body)
-   ❌ Weak phrases like "I think maybe..."

### Template:

> In conclusion, [restate position]. While [acknowledge other side briefly], [main point summary]. [Optional: recommendation or future thought].

### Example:

> In conclusion, I believe that public services should receive the majority of government funding, though some support for the arts is also justified. A balanced approach, allocating perhaps 80% to essential services and 20% to cultural programs, would serve society's needs while preserving cultural heritage. Governments must recognize that both practical and cultural needs contribute to a thriving nation.

## 📝 Sample Essay: Opinion Type

### Question:

> "Some people believe that social media has a negative impact on society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"

### Sample Answer:

**Introduction:**
Social networking platforms have become an integral part of modern life, but their effects on society remain controversial. While I acknowledge that social media offers certain benefits, I largely agree that its overall impact has been negative, particularly regarding mental health and the spread of misinformation.

**Body 1:**
One of the primary concerns about social media is its detrimental effect on mental health, especially among young people. Constant exposure to idealized images and curated lifestyles on platforms like Instagram can lead to feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and depression. Research conducted by the Royal Society for Public Health in the UK found that Instagram was ranked as the worst social media platform for young people's mental health. This evidence suggests that the psychological harm caused by these platforms is substantial and should not be underestimated.

**Body 2:**
Furthermore, social media has become a breeding ground for misinformation and polarized opinions. Unlike traditional media, which typically undergoes editorial review, content on social platforms can be posted by anyone without verification. This has led to the rapid spread of fake news, conspiracy theories, and divisive content. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, social media was flooded with dangerous health misinformation that undermined public health efforts. Such examples demonstrate how these platforms can pose serious risks to society.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, although social media has revolutionized communication, I firmly believe its negative effects outweigh the benefits. The mental health consequences and the proliferation of misinformation present significant challenges that must be addressed. Governments and technology companies should work together to implement stricter regulations and promote digital literacy to mitigate these harmful effects.

## 📝 Sample Essay: Discussion Type

### Question:

> "Some people think that universities should provide students with practical skills for their future careers, while others believe the function of universities is to provide access to knowledge for its own sake. Discuss both views and give your opinion."

### Sample Answer:

**Introduction:**
The purpose of higher education has long been debated, with some advocating for career-focused training while others value the pursuit of knowledge as an end in itself. This essay will examine both perspectives before presenting my own view that universities should strive to balance these objectives.

**Body 1 (View 1):**
Proponents of practical, career-oriented education argue that universities should prepare students for the workforce. In today's competitive job market, employers increasingly seek candidates with specific skills and experience. By offering vocational training, internships, and industry-relevant courses, universities can ensure that graduates are employable immediately upon completion of their studies. Countries like Germany, with their dual education system combining academic study with vocational training, have lower youth unemployment rates, suggesting that practical skills enhance career prospects.

**Body 2 (View 2):**
On the other hand, those who champion knowledge for its own sake contend that universities serve a broader cultural and intellectual purpose. They argue that the pursuit of understanding in fields such as philosophy, history, and pure sciences enriches society and fosters critical thinking. Moreover, academic research often leads to innovations that have practical applications later. For example, Einstein's theoretical work in physics eventually led to technologies like GPS. From this perspective, the value of knowledge cannot always be measured by immediate economic outcomes.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, both views have considerable merit. While practical skills are undeniably important for employment, the pursuit of knowledge contributes to intellectual and cultural development. I believe that universities should offer a balanced curriculum that equips students with marketable skills while also encouraging the exploration of ideas for their intrinsic value. This approach would produce well-rounded graduates who can contribute to both the economy and society at large.
