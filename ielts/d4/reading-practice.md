## 📋 Question Type 1: MATCHING HEADINGS

### What It Tests

-   Understanding main idea of each paragraph
-   Distinguishing between main point and details

### Strategy

**Step 1: Read ALL headings first** (1-2 min)

-   Underline key words
-   Note themes and topics
-   Look for contrasts/opposites

**Step 2: Skim each paragraph**

-   Read first 2 sentences carefully
-   Read last sentence
-   Identify the MAIN IDEA (not details)

**Step 3: Match and eliminate**

-   Choose best match
-   Cross off used headings
-   Don't second-guess too much

### Common Traps

| Trap                               | How to Avoid                           |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Same word in heading and paragraph | Same word ≠ correct! Check meaning     |
| Detail vs. main idea               | Ask: "What is this paragraph ABOUT?"   |
| Two headings seem to fit           | One is usually a detail, not main idea |

### Heading Patterns

| If heading mentions... | Paragraph probably discusses... |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Origins/History        | How something began             |
| Causes/Reasons         | Why something happens           |
| Effects/Impact         | Results/consequences            |
| Solution/Response      | How to fix a problem            |
| Challenges/Problems    | Difficulties faced              |
| Benefits/Advantages    | Positive aspects                |
| Drawbacks/Limitations  | Negative aspects                |
| Future/Outlook         | Predictions/prospects           |

### Practice: Match Headings

**Headings:**
i. The environmental cost of progress
ii. A new approach to conservation
iii. Historical context of the issue
iv. Economic factors driving change
v. Limitations of current solutions
vi. Government response

**Paragraph A:**

> The industrial revolution of the 18th century marked a turning point in human history. Factories emerged across Europe, powered first by water and then by coal. This period saw unprecedented growth in manufacturing, but it also initiated patterns of resource extraction and environmental damage that continue to this day.

**Best heading for Paragraph A:** **\_** (Answer: iii)

## 📋 Question Type 2: TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN

### Key Definitions

| Answer        | Definition                 | Example                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TRUE**      | Statement agrees with text | Text: "Water is essential" → Statement: "Water is necessary" ✓ |
| **FALSE**     | Statement contradicts text | Text: "Water is essential" → Statement: "Water is optional" ✗  |
| **NOT GIVEN** | Information not in text    | Text: "Water is essential" → Statement: "Water is cheap" ?     |

### Step-by-Step Strategy

1. **Read statement** carefully - underline keywords
2. **Locate** relevant section in text
3. **Compare** statement with text EXACTLY
4. **Decide:**
    - Same meaning? → TRUE
    - Opposite meaning? → FALSE
    - Topic mentioned but not this specific claim? → NOT GIVEN

### FALSE vs. NOT GIVEN

| FALSE                  | NOT GIVEN                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Text says the opposite | Text doesn't mention this at all           |
| Direct contradiction   | Related topic, but not this specific point |
| You can prove it wrong | You cannot prove it right OR wrong         |

### Practice Examples
