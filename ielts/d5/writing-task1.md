## 📝 Sample Answer Structure

### Line Graph Question:

> "The graph shows coffee and tea consumption in the UK from 1990 to 2020."

### Sample Answer:

**Introduction:**
The line graph illustrates the consumption levels of coffee and tea in the United Kingdom over a 30-year period, from 1990 to 2020.
