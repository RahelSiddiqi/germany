## 🗣️ Cue Card 1: A Book

> **Describe a book you have read that you found interesting.**
>
> You should say:
>
> -   what the book was called
> -   what it was about
> -   why you decided to read it
> -   and explain why you found it interesting

### Sample Answer:

**Introduction (15 sec):**
"I'd like to talk about a book called 'Atomic Habits' by James Clear, which I read about six months ago. It's a self-improvement book that focuses on how small changes in behavior can lead to remarkable results."

**What it was about (20 sec):**
"The book is essentially about the science of habit formation. The author explains how habits work, why they're so powerful, and most importantly, how to build good habits while breaking bad ones. He introduces the concept of getting just one percent better each day."

**Why I decided to read it (20 sec):**
"Actually, a colleague recommended it to me. I was going through a period where I felt stuck in my routine and wanted to make some positive changes in my life. The title caught my attention, and the reviews were excellent."

**Why I found it interesting (40 sec):**
"What really made this book stand out was how practical it was. Unlike many self-help books that are full of vague advice, this one provided concrete strategies and real-world examples. For instance, the author explains the 'two-minute rule' – if you want to build a habit, start with something that takes just two minutes.

I found it fascinating how small actions compound over time. Since reading it, I've implemented several of the techniques, like habit stacking and environment design, and they've genuinely made a difference in my daily routine."

**Conclusion (15 sec):**
"Overall, I'd highly recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their productivity or break negative patterns. It's definitely one of the most useful books I've ever read."

> -   what qualities this person has
> -   and explain how this person has influenced you

### Sample Answer:

**Introduction:**
"I'd like to describe my high school English teacher, Mrs. Rahman, who had a profound impact on my life. She taught me for three years, from grades 9 to 11, and I still remember her vividly."

**How you know them:**
"I was a student in her advanced English class. Initially, I didn't have much confidence in my language abilities, but she recognized something in me that I couldn't see myself. She would often stay after class to discuss literature and writing techniques with me."

**Qualities:**
"What set her apart was her remarkable patience and genuine passion for teaching. She never made anyone feel stupid for asking questions. She also had an incredible ability to make classic literature feel relevant and exciting. Her enthusiasm was absolutely contagious."

**Influence:**
"Her influence on me has been substantial. Firstly, she transformed my relationship with English – I went from being an average student to someone who genuinely loves the language. She encouraged me to write more, and that eventually led me to start a blog.

More importantly, she taught me the value of perseverance. She often said, 'The first draft is always terrible, and that's okay.' This mindset has helped me in many areas of life beyond writing."

**Conclusion:**
"To this day, whenever I face a challenging task, I remember her words of encouragement. She's the reason I'm as confident in English as I am today."

"A place I've been dreaming of visiting for years is Iceland, a small Nordic island nation in the North Atlantic Ocean. It's famous for its dramatic landscapes and natural wonders."

**What you know about it:**
"From what I've read and seen in documentaries, Iceland has some of the most unique geography on Earth. There are active volcanoes, massive glaciers, hot springs, and the famous Northern Lights. The capital, Reykjavik, is known as one of the cleanest and greenest cities in the world. The country also has a rich Viking heritage and a strong literary tradition."

**How you would travel:**
"I'd fly directly to Reykjavik, which takes around three to four hours from London. Once there, I'd probably rent a car to drive the famous Ring Road, which circles the entire island. The whole trip would ideally be about ten days to two weeks to really explore properly."

**Why you want to visit:**
"There are several reasons I'm drawn to Iceland. Firstly, I'm fascinated by natural phenomena, and seeing the Northern Lights has been on my bucket list for as long as I can remember. Secondly, I'm an amateur photographer, and Iceland offers some of the most photogenic landscapes in the world.

Additionally, I find the concept of geothermal energy really interesting, and Iceland leads the world in renewable energy. I'd love to see how a country can run almost entirely on sustainable power."

**Conclusion:**
"I've started saving for this trip, and I'm hoping to make it happen within the next year or two. It would truly be a dream come true."
