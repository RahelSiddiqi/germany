## 🎯 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### What MUST Happen (Non-Negotiable):

1. **IELTS by end of January** (Target: 6.5+, Acceptable: 6.0+)

    - Without this, you can't apply
    - If first attempt fails, retake in February

2. **Apply to 10-12 universities** (Mix of all tiers)

    - More applications = higher success probability
    - Don't put all hopes on 2-3 universities!

3. **Apply to 6-8 scholarships**

    - Even if you think you won't get them
    - You CAN'T win if you don't play!

4. **Meet ALL deadlines**

    - Set calendar reminders 2 weeks before each deadline
    - Apply EARLY, not last day!

5. **Complete documentation**
    - One missing document = application rejected
    - Triple-check before submitting!
